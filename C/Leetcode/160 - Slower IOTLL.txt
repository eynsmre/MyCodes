struct ListNode getIntersectionNode(struct ListNode headA, struct ListNode headB) {
     Create two pointers, tempA and tempB, which will be used to iterate through the linked lists
    struct ListNode tempA = headA, tempB = headB;

     Iterate through the linked list pointed to by tempB
    while(tempB){
         For each element in tempB, reset tempA to the head of list A
        tempA = headA;
        
         Iterate through the linked list pointed to by tempA
        while(tempA){
             Check if the current element of tempA is the same as tempB
            if(tempA == tempB)
                 If they are the same, we have found the intersection node
                return tempA;

             Move to the next element in list A
            tempA= tempA-next;
        }
         Move to the next element in list B
        tempB= tempB-next;
    }

     If we reach the end of both lists without finding an intersection, return NULL
    return NULL;
}
